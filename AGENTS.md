# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds the React/TanStack Router app code.
- `src/routes/` contains file-based routes (e.g., `index.tsx`, `__root.tsx`).
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated by the TanStack Router plugin.
- `src-tauri/` contains the Tauri Rust backend.
- `public/` is for static assets served as-is.
- `src/assets/` is for bundled frontend assets.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `pnpm` (lockfile is `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- `pnpm dev` runs the Vite dev server.
- `pnpm build` runs TypeScript checks and builds the Vite app.
- `pnpm preview` serves the production build locally.
- `pnpm tauri` runs Tauri CLI commands (e.g., `pnpm tauri dev`).
- `pnpm biome:check` validates formatting/linting.
- `pnpm biome:fix` applies safe lint/format fixes.
- `pnpm biome:lint` runs lint rules only.
- `pnpm biome:format` formats files.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Formatting/linting is enforced by Biome (`biome.json`).
- Indentation: 2 spaces; quotes: double.
- React components use `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserCard.tsx`).
- Routes follow TanStack file-based naming (e.g., `src/routes/settings.tsx`).

## UI & Styling
- Tailwind CSS is the primary styling system; prefer utility classes in JSX.
- Color variables are defined in `src/main.css`; keep the same color scheme when adding UI.
- Prefer shadcn/ui components instead of building new components from scratch.
- Install new shadcn/ui components via `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`.
- shadcn/ui components live under `src/components/ui/`; customize via props and class utilities instead of rewriting markup.
- Hugeicons are used for iconography; import from `@hugeicons/react` and keep icon usage consistent (size/color via className).

## Testing Guidelines
No test framework is configured yet. If you add tests, document the runner and add a `pnpm test` script. Prefer colocating tests near code (e.g., `src/components/Button.test.tsx`).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages use Conventional Commits (examples from history: `chore: ...`).
- Keep commits scoped and descriptive.
- PRs should include: a short summary, key changes, and screenshots for UI changes.

## Configuration Tips
- The TanStack Router Vite plugin auto-generates `src/routeTree.gen.ts`; don’t edit it manually.
- `src-tauri/` is excluded from Biome checks; keep Rust formatting to `cargo fmt`.
